Design and implement the necessary database schema and models to store and retrieve the data efficiently.\n 3. Server-side Logic: Use a server-side scripting language like Node.js with Express.js, Python with Django or Flask, Ruby on Rails, or Java with Spring Boot to handle server-side logic, interact with the database, and manage application state.\n 4. E-Commerce for Dental Products: Implement a shopping cart and checkout system for purchasing items.\n 5. Code Review: Perform a thorough code review to identify and fix issues with code quality, security, performance, and functionality, ensuring compliance with standards, optimizing for scalability, and maintaining clear documentation.\n\n After implementing the code, you will need to provide me with a review report addressing the following points:\n\n 1. Appointment Booking: Ensure the system accurately handles scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellations.\n 2. Database Performance: Assess query efficiency and optimization for patient data management.\n 3. Edge Cases: Evaluate the system\u2019s handling of appointment conflicts and time zone adjustments.\n 4. Security: Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n 5. Django Standards: Verify adherence to Django\u2019s coding conventions and best practices.\n 6. Code Quality: Review for readability, maintainability, and ease of future updates.\n\n Additionally, please suggest any improvements or optimizations that could enhance the application's functionality, performance, or maintainability.",
